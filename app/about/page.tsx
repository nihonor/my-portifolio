        <p className="py-4">
          Iâ€™m Niyitanga Honore, a cybersecurity enthusiast and full-stack
          developer with a passion for securing digital systems and building
          efficient web applications. My expertise lies in penetration testing,
          ethical hacking, and malware analysis, where I analyze system
          vulnerabilities, investigate attack vectors, and develop
          countermeasures to enhance security. I have hands-on experience with
          tools like Metasploit, Sysmon, and Windows event log analysis, and Iâ€™m
          always exploring new ways to strengthen digital defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a developer, I specialize in React, Node.js, and Next.js, creating
          modern and scalable applications. I enjoy working on backend
          optimizations, database management, and security-focused web
          development, ensuring that applications are both performant and
          resistant to threats. I also have a strong background in Python, which
          I use for automation, scripting, and security research. Additionally,
          I have experience setting up secure network environments in VirtualBox
          and troubleshooting networking challenges, making me adept at both
          offensive and defensive security strategies.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4">
          Beyond my technical skills, Iâ€™m passionate about teaching and sharing
          knowledge. Iâ€™ve designed a one-hour Python for cybersecurity crash
          course, covering essential programming concepts with a
          security-focused approach. I love breaking down complex topics into
          digestible lessons, helping others understand the importance of secure
          coding and system hardening.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive on solving challenges, whether itâ€™s exploiting a vulnerable
          machine, analyzing malware behavior, or optimizing a web applicationâ€™s
          security architecture. My goal is to bridge the gap between
          development and cybersecurity, ensuring that every system I work on is
          both functional and resilient.
